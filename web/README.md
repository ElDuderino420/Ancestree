# Web Frontend

## Basic idea

Page split in two. One side shows graph the other side shows profile. 

Profile has information about current selected person
    Links to parents, siblings, married/has kids with, children's profile
    Profile can be edited (by famiiy member) (ðŸ’¡ https://editorjs.io/ maybe... always wanted to use this) (this other validation library..? ðŸ¤”)
    Information like wiki page.. 
Graph shows full familiy free for seleced person
    Option to add child/parent to current selected node
    Basic form for adding - quick add.. 

Login (with... OAuth2) and link to person

View/Browse other OAuth user's family tree
